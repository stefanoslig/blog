### Introduction

In version 16.0.0-next.0 the Angular team introduced a very first implementation of `Signals` which is a reactive primitive which can offer fine-grained reactivity in Angular. With such big changes like a new reactive primitive, considering also other very useful features the Angular team has introduced in the latest versions like the [inject](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/inject) function or the concept of [DestroyRef](https://next.angular.io/api/core/DestroyRef), it's anavoidable that new patterns will emerge. 

This article is an attempt to explore and give a name to something that maybe a lot of you have already thought. A new pattern that can emerge out of the introduction of `Signals`. This is not a new concept. It's already used and tested in other framewroks like `Vue.js`. Let's explore it in the next paragraphs, in the context of Angular this time.
